### Backend & Platform Engineering  
Zurich, Switzerland

I build reliable backend systems and platform tooling with a focus on automation, containers, cloud infrastructure, and developer experience.

Currently exploring distributed systems, Web3 fundamentals, and internal platform engineering patterns.
